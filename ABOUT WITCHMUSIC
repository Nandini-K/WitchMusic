In this project, we have implemented multiple machine learning algorithms to predict the genre of a given soundtrack. The dataset we used
for this is The Million Song Dataset, which is a freely-available collection of audio features and metadata for a million contemporary
popular music tracks. The dataset can be downloaded from http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/. However, for the purpose of this
project we'd be using a subset of this dataset consisting of 10,000 songs, which is also available on the aforementioned webpage.

If you'd like to see how this works and check out the results, follow the instructions given below :-
1. Make sure your system has all the software/packages required and enough disk space.
2. Extract the folder "data" from the dataset and store it in the current working directory.
3. Execute the code files in the following sequence -
	a. FeatureExtract.py
	b. Labelling.py
	c. MatchLabels.py
	d. ReshapeData.py
Now the data is ready to be trained. You can execute the various given algorithm implementations and see the results.
