# About WitchMusic

In this project, we have implemented multiple machine learning algorithms, such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Reggression, Support Vector Machines and Nueral Networks, to predict the genre of a given soundtrack. The dataset we used for this is The Million Song Dataset, which is a freely-available collection of audio features and metadata for a million contemporary popular music tracks. The dataset can be downloaded from http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/ or by clicking [here](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/pages/getting-dataset). However, for the purpose of this project we'd be using a subset of this dataset consisting of 10,000 songs, which can also be downloaded from the above webpage or by clicking [here](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/pages/getting-dataset#subset).

If you'd like to see how this works and check out the results, follow the instructions given below :-

1. Make sure your system has all of the following software/packages required and enough disk space -

	a. Python 2.7.11

	b. Python packages: pytables, h5py, scipy, numpy, scikit-learn, scikit-neuralnetwork, python-matplotlib

2. Extract the folder "data" from the dataset and store it in the current working directory

3. Download this project, extract all the files in your current working directory

4. Execute the file AutoRun.py
